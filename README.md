# Titanic_RandomForest
Random Forest algorithm was used to predict the surviving passengers from the Titanic disaster.
The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)
The training set should be used to build your machine-learning models. For the training set, we provide each passenger with the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”). Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. We do not provide the ground truth for the test set for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to indicate whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
That above was a part of the Kaggle competition, I used the RandomForest algorithm to predict survived passengers with an accuracy of 78%.
